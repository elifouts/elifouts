# 👋 Hi there, I'm Eli `elifouts`

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate **Computer Science student** at the University of Cincinnati, currently on my second Co-Op journey. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me skiing down slopes, hiking rugged trails, or camping under the stars. I've been skiing since I could walk, and I'm always looking for the next adventure! 🏔️🎿

- 🌍 From: Cincinnati, Ohio
- 💻 Current Role: Co-Op at Saratech
- 🎯 Goals: Improve technical problem-solving and learn new things along the way.
